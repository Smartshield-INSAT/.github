# Smartshield: TSYP 12 Technical Challenge

## About Us
Smartshield is a cutting-edge cybersecurity solution designed to monitor, analyze, and detect network anomalies in real-time. Our platform leverages powerful technologies, including machine learning and generative AI, to provide actionable insights into network traffic, helping organizations stay ahead of emerging threats. Through our innovative use of Docker, containerization, and scalable microservices, we aim to simplify the management of network security, making it more accessible and efficient.

## Our Mission
Our mission is to revolutionize network security monitoring through seamless automation, intelligent anomaly detection, and insightful reporting. By combining machine learning, generative AI, and an intuitive UI, Smartshield-INSAT aims to empower enterprises to proactively detect and mitigate potential security threats in their networks, enhancing both security and operational efficiency.

This project sets up an infrastructure with the following services:

- **Elasticsearch**: A powerful search engine for indexing and querying data.
- **Kibana**: A visualization tool to explore data stored in Elasticsearch.
- **RabbitMQ**: A message broker with a management interface.
- **PCAP Processor** (our image): A custom service for processing PCAP files with (zeek/argus/pyshark).
- **Frontend**: A React-based application that provides an interface for interacting with the data and services. 
- **Backend**: A NestJS application that serves as the API layer, managing communication between the frontend, PCAP Processor, ML Models.
- **ML Engine**: A machine learning model for detecting anomalies in the network, used to identify potential threats or irregularities.
- **Generative AI Report Generator**: An AI-driven tool that generates detailed reports based on processed data, providing insights into detected anomalies or patterns.
